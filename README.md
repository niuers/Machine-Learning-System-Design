## When to Use Machine Learning?
1. Machine learning is an approach to **learn** **complex** **patterns** from **existing data** and use these patterns to make **predictions** on **unseen data**.
    * ML can be especially appealing when you can benefit from a large quantity of cheap but approximate predictions.
1. ML is more suitable with following problem characteristics:
    * It's repetitive
    * The cost of wrong predictions is cheap
    * It's at scale
    * The patterns are constantly changing
1. Enterprise applications might have stricter accuracy requirements but less latency requirements.
