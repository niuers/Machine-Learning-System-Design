## When to Use Machine Learning?
1. Machine learning is an approach to **learn** **complex** **patterns** from **existing data** and use these patterns to make **predictions** on **unseen data**.
  1. ML can be especially appealing when you can benefit from a large quantity of cheap but approximate predictions.
1. ML is more suitable with following problem characteristics:
  1. It's repetitive
  2. The cost of wrong predictions is cheap
  3. It's at scale
  4. The patterns are constantly changing
1. Enterprise applications might have stricter accuracy requirements but less latency requirements.
